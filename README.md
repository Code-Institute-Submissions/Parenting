The project intends to be a guideline for women to discover information about pregnancy, giving birth and babies. The aim is to inform users in the best possible way about becoming and being a parent, and to raise awarness about the most important steps in their journey as a parent.

It is designed to be responsive on a range of devices and easy to navigate to find information related to the subject.

## Design

#### Imagery

The logo I created is useful for the site because is underling the title of the website, associating those three elements with the meaning of being pregnant, delivery the baby and the baby. 
I choose a neutral home page background image, as to be in concordance to the other pages, making the reading of the information and navigation through the website more easily. The otherpages images were chosen to be relevant to the topic and to be easy to follow.
The images used are representative for the subjects approached and they have a high resolution for a better style. 

#### Colors

The colour scheme chosen is associated with the babies, pink and blue, and the grey used makes the information to be followed easily.  

#### Typography

The main font used is "Cardo" with "Sans Serif" as a backup font. I chose this font because I considered is easy to follow and read. 

## Wireframes

I created wireframes for Main Pages on desktop, smartphone and tablet using Balsamiq - [View](https://github.com/DomnicaH/Parenting/tree/main/wireframes) <br/>
On all pages I chosen to take out search bar as I considered is not very useful on this stage of the project and as the mentor, Aaron suggested.<br/>
The pregnancy.html page doesn't follow the structure entirely, as I chose to show it on vertical rather than horizontal as I found it easy to integrate on the page. Also, the menu on small devices is not a dropdown menu with the icon. 

## Features

The most important feature I concentrated more was to be responsive on different device sizes. Also, it has a clear navigation, reliable and useful information, social media platforms and sign up to newsletter form.

### Features I want to add

In the future, I would like to extend the project and write about toddler's life and challenges in their milestones development, to add more dynamicity and interaction for the users, like a forum for discussion and links to useful organisation relevant to the site users. Also, I want to create flyers with a well-structured information integrated into the webpages that can be printable and be used to inform women and parents about the most important things for having a healthy pregnancy and babies.<br/>
Also, I want to develop the topics and add more information related and relevant to the subject.<br/>
Adding support for the dual language is a feature that I want to implement as the project extended.
