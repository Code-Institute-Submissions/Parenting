[View the project here](https://domnicah.github.io/Parenting/)


The project intends to be a guideline for women to discover information about pregnancy, giving 
birth and babies. The aim is to inform users in the best possible way about becoming and being a
parent, and to raise awarness about the most important steps in their journey as a parent.

It is designed to be responsive on a range of devices and easy to navigate to find information
related to the subject.

## User Experience (UX)

  ### User stories

contact with supporting organisations.
- As a returning visitor, I want to find social links to a comunity build around the website topics.

 to the website and it's content.

### Design

#### Imagery

The logo I created is useful for the site because is underling the title of the website,
associating those three elements with the meaning of being pregnant, delivery the baby
and the baby. 
I choose a neutral home page background image, as to be in concordance to the other pages,
making the reading of the information and navigation through the website more easily. The other
pages images were chosen in order to be relevant to the topic and to be easily to follow.
The images used are representative for the subjects approached and they have a high resolution for a better style. 

#### Colors

The color scheme chosen is associated with the babies, pink and blue, and the grey used makes
the information to be followed easily.  

#### Typography

The main font used is "Cardo" with "Sans Serif" as a backup font. I chosen this font because
I considered is easy to follow and read. 


### Wireframes

I created wireframes for Main Pages on desktop, smartphone and tablet using Balsamiq - [View](https://github.com/DomnicaH/Parenting/tree/main/wireframes)
On all pages I chosen to take out search bar as I considered is not very useful on this stage 
of the project.
The pregnancy.html page doesn't follow the structure entirely, as I chosed to show it on vertical rather
than horizontal as I found easily to integrated on the page. 


# Features

The most important feature I concentrated more was to be responsive on different device sizes. ALso it has
a clear navigation, reliable and useful information, social media platforms and sign up to newsletter form.


# Features I want to add

In the future, I would like to add more projects, as a continuity of babies life and write about toddler's life and challanges in their milestones development. Also, I would like to create flyers with a well structered information integrated in the webpages that can be printable.
Also, I would like to add more dinamicity and interection for the users, like a forum for discusion and links to useful organisation relevant for the site users.
Add more information related to the subject.
Add supportfor dual language.
